# AutoTest
This project is still in progress!

AutoTest is a tool to automatically generate unit tests for c# projects. The goal is not to replace practices like TDD or manually doing unit tests but to help developers generate unit tests for older legacy projects which they may not have developed.
This tool will generate the unit tests assuming every behavior is working correctly. This will help developers to refactor the legacy project without introducing new bugs or changing the current behavior.
Part of this tool may also be used as a helper for code generating in other projects you may have. If proven useful, will later be extracted to a different project.
